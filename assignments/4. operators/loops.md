1. ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
 * [ ] Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.
 * [ ] Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.
```js
const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

var bank_balance = 303.91;
var amount = 0;
// your code goes here
while ( amount <= bank_balance) {
        amount += PHONE_PRICE;
        while(amount <= SPENDING_THRESHOLD) {
            amount += ACCESSORY_PRICE;
        }
}
// Calculate tax function
let calculateTax = () => {
    let total = 0;
    total = amount * TAX_RATE;
    amount = total + amount;
    return amount;
}

// Formate amount function
let formatAmount = () => `$ ${amount.toFixed(2)}`;

// Check amount against account bal
let checkPermission = (amount <= bank_balance) ? 'Yes, you can buy it' : 'You don\'t have enough money in your account'; 
```
 â›‘ Answer of the above will `$334.76`.

2. ðŸŽ– Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen using `alert` (e.g. "2 is even").
```js
// your code goes here
for ( let num = 1; num <= 20; ++num ) {
    if ( num % 2 == 0) {
        alert(`${num} is even`);
    }
    else {
        alert(`${num} is odd`)
    }
}

```
3. ðŸŽ–Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result in console (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(`${i} * 9 = ${i * 9}`);
}

```
4. ðŸŽ–Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).
(e.g.
"1 * 1 = 1"
"1 * 2 = 2"
"1 * 3 = 3"
"1 * 4 = 4"
.... for all 100 results)

```js
    for (let r = 1; r <= 10; r++ ) {
        for (let p = 1; p <= 10; p++) {
            console.log(`${r} * ${p} = ${r*p}`);
        }
    }
```

5. ðŸŽ–Show the following output using one loop.
```js
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

// Your code goes here
let str = "";
let str2 = "";
for (let k = 1; k <= 10; k++) {
	if (k > 5) {
	str2 = str2 + " " + k;
    }
	else {
	str = str +" " + k;
    }
}
console.log(str);
console.log(str2);
```

6. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20.
```js
// Your code goes here
let num = 0;
let sum = 0;
let start = 0;
while ( start < 20) {
    num = ++num;
    sum += num;
    ++ start;
}
console.log(sum);
```

7. ðŸŽ–Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.)
```js
// Your code goes here
let num = 1;
while ( num < 20 ) {
    if ( num % 2 == 0) {
        console.log(num);
    }
    ++num;
}
```

## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Mathematical Operations:
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.
var decreasedValue = amount - 80;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.
var increasedValue = amount + 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.
var multipliedValue = amount * 4;
// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
```
Logical Operation
```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark
    johnAge > markAge ? 'John is older': 'Mark is older'; 
// Check who is younger
    johnAge < markAge ? 'John is younger': 'Mark is younger'; 
// Check if their age is equal
    johnAge === markAge ? 'Yes, their age is equal' : 'No, their age isn\'t equal';
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.
    let johnNewAge = johnAge;
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
    johnAge >= markAge ? 'John is older': 'Mark is older'; 
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.
    johnAge <= margkAge ? 'John is less then or equal to john" : 'John isn\'t less then or equal to john";
// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
    let totalAge = johnAge + markAge;
    let averageAge = totalAge / 2;
```

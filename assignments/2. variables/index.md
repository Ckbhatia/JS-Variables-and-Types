## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Mathematical Operations:
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.
var decreasedValue = amount - 80;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.
var increasedValue = amount + 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.
var multipliedValue = amount * 4;
// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
```
Logical Operation
```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark
    johnAge > markAge;
// Check who is younger
    johnAge < markAge;
// Check if their age is equal
    johnAge === markAge;
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.
    let johnNewAge = johnAge;
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
    johnAge >= markAge
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.
    johnAge <= margkAge;
// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
    let totalAge = johnAge + markAge;
    let averageAge = totalAge / 2;
```
